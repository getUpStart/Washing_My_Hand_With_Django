# Django REST Framework Project
Welcome to my Django project where I am learning and implementing various functionalities of Django along with Django REST Framework. In this project, I aim to cover the following topics:

# Setting up a local development server with Docker.
Writing a Python project using Test Driven Development (TDD).
Building a REST API with advanced features such as uploading and viewing images.
# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker
Python
Django

Installation
# Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/django-rest-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd django-rest-project

# Build the Docker image:
docker-compose build

# Run the Docker containers:
docker-compose up

Access the application at http://localhost:8000

# Learning Objectives
Setting up a local development server with Docker
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. In this project, we'll set up our Django development environment using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying the setup process.

# Writing a Python project using Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. By following TDD principles, we ensure that our code is thoroughly tested and reliable.

# Building a REST API with advanced features
Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. In this project, we'll explore how to leverage DRF to build a RESTful API with advanced features such as image uploading and viewing. This will involve understanding serializers, views, permissions, and other DRF components to create a robust API that meets our project requirements.
